    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Baklava is a delectable pastry with layers of filo dough, sweet syrup, and
      nuts. Azerbaijani Baklava, influenced by Persian and Turkish cuisines,
      features ground walnuts and aromatic spices like cardamom. It is known for
      its crisp texture and the use of rose water in the syrup. Azerbaijani
      Baklava is often enjoyed during special occasions, symbolizing warmth and
      celebration. The preparation of Baklava is a communal experience, bringing
      families together to create this traditional treat and pass down knowledge
      across generations.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>8 ounces unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda (bicarbonate of soda)</li>
      <li>2 egg yolks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups sugar</li>
      <li>2 egg whites</li>
      <li>
        3 cups (10 ounces) walnuts, ground (they should be somewhat crunchy in
        the pie, so do not grind finely)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Top</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 egg yolk, to glaze</li>
      <li>Handful of walnut halves, to decorate</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the dough. In a large bowl, combine the flour and butter. Using
        a pastry blender or a knife or a fork, cut in the butter until coarse
        meal (pea size crumbs) forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl combine the sour cream and baking soda and add to the
        butter mixture. Add the eggs yolks. Toss with your hands until the
        mixture comes together in a rough mass then knead briefly until you
        obtain smooth and gentle dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 3 equal parts, forming each one into a thick disk.
        Wrap each disk in a plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1
        hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the filling. In a mixing bowl, combine the sugar and egg whites.
        Using an electric mixer, beat until until well blended, 3 minutes. Add
        the walnuts and stir with a spoon to combine.
      </li>
      <li>Butter the bottom and the sides of a 8 x 12-inch baking pan.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350F.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Lightly dust your work surface
        with flour. Using a rolling pin, press firmly to roll out the dough into
        a rectangle the size to fit the pan. Carefully transfer the rectangle to
        the prepared pan, gently pressing the dough against the bottom and the
        sides of the pan. (Also, slightly stretching the dough to the sides and
        sealing the edges will keep the releasing juices inside.) Repair any
        tears in the dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread half of the filling over the dough layer. Roll the second disk in
        the same way and place on top of the walnut filling. Spread the
        remaining filling over this layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the third dough disk and cover the walnut filling with it. Press
        slightly on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush with the egg yolk. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the baklava
        in cross-hatching diagonals to make diamond shapes (first cut 4 parallel
        lines lengthways, then several across and at an angle) , cutting through
        the filling all the way to the bottom. If you wish, you can also cut the
        baklava into squares. Pace half a walnut into the middle of each baklava
        piece and press slightly to adher to the dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake on the middle rack of the oven until golden on top, 35 to 45
        minutes. Remove from the oven. The baklava will will appear puffed up â€“
        this is normal; as it cools off it will settle. Allow to cool completely
        (Important!) in the pan, then carefully lift out the baklava pieces from
        the pan. Store in a covered container.
