    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Dolma, also known as Yarpaq Dolmasi, is a traditional Azerbaijani dish
      that showcases the rich culinary heritage of Azerbaijan. Dolma refers to
      stuffed vegetables, and Yarpaq Dolmasi specifically refers to dolma made
      with vine leaves. Yarpaq Dolmasi is prepared by carefully wrapping a
      flavorful mixture of rice, ground meat, herbs, and spices in tender vine
      leaves. The dolmas are then gently cooked until the flavors meld together,
      resulting in a delicious and aromatic dish. Yarpaq Dolmasi is often
      enjoyed during festive occasions and family gatherings, symbolizing
      abundance and togetherness. The preparation of Yarpaq Dolmasi is
      considered an art form, passed down through generations, with each family
      adding its unique touch to the recipe.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb ground lamb and/or beef</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2/3 cup rice (short or medium grain), washed and drained</li>
      <li>1 small bunch cilantro, chopped</li>
      <li>1 small bunch dill, chopped</li>
      <li>15 fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
      <li>65 fresh vine leaves (or canned)</li>
      <li>4 tbsp butter, melted</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>
        Optional: 1/2 cup plain yoghurt, mixed with 2 chopped garlic cloves
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix the ground meat, onion, rice, fresh herbs, salt and
        pepper and knead vigorously for 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Dolmas</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        *If using fresh grape leaves, blanch 10 at a time in a large saucepan of
        boiling water for 2 minutes. This will soften the leaves and make them
        easier to roll. Remove the leaves with a slotted spoon. Cut the stems or
        hard veins.
      </li>
      <li>
        *If using canned leaves, place them in a large colander and rinse
        thoroughly with cold water. Cut stems or hard veins. If canned leaves
        are too thick, blanch in boiling water, in the same manner as fresh
        leaves, but only for one minute, then drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the shiny side of the grape leaf down on a board or in the palm of
        your hand, and place 1 teaspoon of stuffing at the basis of the stem of
        the leaf. Fold the lower end of the sheet up, then fold its sides over
        the filling and roll. You can also use a dolma wrapper for a quicker and
        easier process.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a Dutch oven or non-stick pot, place the stuffed grape leaves, close
        to each other. You can make several layers if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using fresh grape leaves, sprinkle a little salt between each layer.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the melted butter over the grape leaves and add the water.</li>
      <li>
        If necessary, place a small lid or a small plate on top of the dolmas to
        keep them tight and to prevent them from opening.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium/low heat and simmer for
        1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours or until the leaves are tender.
      </li>
      <li>Serve dolmas hot or warm accompanied by garlic yogurt.</li>
