        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Qutab is a delightful Azerbaijani dish that holds a special place in
          the cuisine of Azerbaijan. Qutab can be described as a type of savory
          stuffed pancake or turnover. The thin dough is filled with a variety
          of delicious fillings, such as ground meat, herbs, cheese, or
          vegetables. Qutab is typically cooked on a hot griddle, resulting in a
          crispy exterior while the filling remains tender and flavorful. It is
          often served with a dollop of yogurt or a tangy herb sauce, adding a
          refreshing element to the dish. Qutab is a popular street food in
          Azerbaijan and is enjoyed as a quick snack or as part of a larger
          meal. Its versatility and delightful flavors make it a beloved dish
          among locals and visitors alike.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Dough</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Boil about 4 to 5 of the water in a pan.</li>
          <li>In another pan combine the flour and the salt.</li>
          <li>
            Slowly add the boiling water and stir with a wooden spoon. Keep
            adding water until a solid mass forms. At this stage cover the dough
            for a few minutes to cool it down enough to handle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now add the oil and knead the mixture into a soft dough. Sprinkle
            more warm water if needed.
          </li>
          <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a pan and saute the onions and spring onions until just
            soft and translucent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the salt and crushed red pepper to this mixture and mix well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let this mixture cool down and then add the grated / crumbled
            paneer, chopped mint, and cilantro and mix well to combine.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Put together</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.</li>
          <li>
            Dust each ball with enough flour and roll it into a very thin
            circle. Place about 2 tablespoon of filling on one half of the
            rolled dough and cover it with the other half.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seal the edges well and cook it on a hot cast iron or a heavy pan.
            Apply oil on both sides and cook until golden brown.
          </li>
          <li>Let the Kutab cool a bit and then serve.</li>
        </ol>
