      Qutab is a delightful Azerbaijani dish that holds a special place in the
      cuisine of Azerbaijan. Qutab can be described as a type of savory stuffed
      pancake or turnover. The thin dough is filled with a variety of delicious
      fillings, such as ground meat, herbs, cheese, or vegetables. Qutab is
      typically cooked on a hot griddle, resulting in a crispy exterior while

      of yogurt or a tangy herb sauce, adding a refreshing element to the dish.
