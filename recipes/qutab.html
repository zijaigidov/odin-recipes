    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Qutab is a delightful Azerbaijani dish that holds a special place in the
      cuisine of Azerbaijan. Qutab can be described as a type of savory stuffed
      pancake or turnover. The thin dough is filled with a variety of delicious
      fillings, such as ground meat, herbs, cheese, or vegetables. Qutab is
      typically cooked on a hot griddle, resulting in a crispy exterior while

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil about 4 to 5 of the water in a pan.</li>
      <li>In another pan combine the flour and the salt.</li>
      <li>
        Slowly add the boiling water and stir with a wooden spoon. Keep adding
        water until a solid mass forms. At this stage cover the dough for a few
        minutes to cool it down enough to handle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the oil and knead the mixture into a soft dough. Sprinkle more
        warm water if needed.
      </li>
      <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a pan and saute the onions and spring onions until just soft
        and translucent.
      </li>
      <li>Add the salt and crushed red pepper to this mixture and mix well.</li>
      <li>
        Let this mixture cool down and then add the grated / crumbled paneer,
        chopped mint, and cilantro and mix well to combine.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To shape and cook the Qutab</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.</li>
      <li>
        Dust each ball with enough flour and roll it into a very thin circle.
        Place about 2 tablespoon of filling on one half of the rolled dough and
        cover it with the other half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seal the edges well and cook it on a hot cast iron or a heavy pan. Apply
        oil on both sides and cook until golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>Let the Kutab cool a bit and then serve.</li>
    </ol>
